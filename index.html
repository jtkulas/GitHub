## Why you want to do this üÜí

Using a version control platform (such as [GitHub](https://www.github.com)) facilitates collaboration on projects from multiple people (while restricting the number of *versions* of the collaborative material - say **&lt;span style="color:cornflowerblue"&gt;goodbye forever&lt;/span&gt;** to "mypaper(4)_1.32.20_newest.doc"). <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> Studio integrates really easily with GitHub, so it turns out to be a very useful way to share scripts and efficiently work on projects [such as this current tutorial!](https://github.com/jtkulas/GitHub/tree/development)

## How to integrate <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> Studio and GitHub <i class="fab  fa-github "></i>

You first need to install "Git" onto your computer before accessing GitHub through <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> Studio.

This [site](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) (in addition to the next few slides) walk you through the setup. An entire book dedicated to Git and <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> Studio integration is [located here](https://happygitwithr.com/)

## .fancy[Installing Git] 

Git is a platform tool that helps connect the website [GitHub](https://github.com/), and <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> studio. To install Git on you computer go to the website &lt;https://git-scm.com/downloads&gt;. Here is what the website should look like:

## .fancy[What's a "Shell"] üê¢?

At some point you may be asked to operate from within a "shell" (you don't need to do so, but the previous slide's link does ask you to use a shell). A shell is an access point to your computer that operates somewhere behind your operating system (for example, Windows). You can access shells outside of <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> Studio, but if you'd like to access a shell from *within* <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> Studio, you can also do so - the "Terminal" tab within <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> Studio is actually a "shell":

![](Shell.png)

.pull-left[
### Step 1: Connect Git <i class="fab  fa-github "></i> &amp; <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> Studio  

From within <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> Studio: 
- Go to `Tools`  (it is between `Profile` and `Help`) 
- Then, click on `Global Options`
- Next, click on `Git/SVN` 
]

## Step 2: Connect Git <i class="fab  fa-github "></i> &amp; <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> Studio

.pull-left[
Find where you downloaded "Git" and link to the location within the `Git executable:` window

For example, on our windows computer, we navigated to `this PC`
- Click on `Windows (C:)`
- Click on `Program Files Folder`
- Click on `Git Folder`
- Click on `bin folder`
- Click on `git.exe`

# .fancy[Now Wut?!?]

Now you need a project to collaborate on. You can use [this current presentation](https://github.com/jtkulas/GitHub/tree/development) as an example project if you wanna be meta!!! (just beware we use some packages that you'll need to install via `devtools` because they're hosted on GitHub <i class="fab  fa-github " style="color:black;"></i>, not CRAN). If meta scares you, you can try a [simpler project](https://github.com/jtkulas/temp/tree/master).

## .fancy[[Connecting to a GitHub project (Step I)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxZ8J2rqhEM)]

First access the GitHub repository that you'd like to connect to, then copy the web URL to your clipboard:

## .fancy[[Connecting to a GitHub project (Step II)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxZ8J2rqhEM)]

Once you've copied the GitHub repository url, open <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> Studio. Then, within the <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> Studio interface follow the wizard via: File `\(\rightarrow\)` New Project `\(\rightarrow\)` Version Control:

## .fancy[[Connecting to a GitHub project (Step III)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxZ8J2rqhEM)]

Continue with `\(\rightarrow\)` Git and then paste the GitHub repository address that you previously copied into the `Repository URL:` window.

Note that you'll also need to indicate a local (on your computer) location for the files...

## .fancy[Connecting to a GitHub project (Success!!!)] 

You now have a "project" that you can access from within <i class="fab  fa-r-project fa-spin " style="color:cornflowerblue;"></i> Studio, but is linked to the GitHub files (as well as somewhere locally on your computer)

![](linked.png)

---

## Then what?

You can now work on shared <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> files via local editing. A "commit" saves your edits, whereas a "push" sends your saved changes (aka "commits") to the online GitHub repository, but only if you have permission to do so.

There's a decent YouTube overview of the workflow process  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLycV1IWqc)

![](commit.png)

---

## Pushing and Pulling

After working on a project (on your computer), you'll likely want to upload your changes to your Github repository. You do this by accessing the 1. `Git` tab from within <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> Studio. Select the documents you'd like to upload and hit the 2. `commit` button. 

![](Image/commit.jpg)
---

## Pushing to Github

Committing initializes a pop up window where you will annotate your changes (e.g., what and why you did to the files). After 1. `committing`, you also need to 2. `push` to send those changes back up to the GitHub repository. Once you do that, everyone who you are collaborating with can see and access the changes.

![](Image/push.jpg)

## Tips of the trade

.pull-left[The previous slides should be sufficient to get you connected to a project that's hosted on GitHub.  

The following slides focus on some workflow recommendations - how we think you should (at least initially) use GitHub through <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> Studio  

1. Inviting collaborators
2. Using notifications
2. Structuring (forking and branching)

## .fancy[Collaborating with others]

You can invite collaborators to contribute to your projects. This is actually how you "grant permission" for others to push to your repository. However, before you do this (from within your GitHub account), &lt;span style="color:cornflowerblue"&gt;**they**&lt;/span&gt; need a GitHub account and &lt;span style="color:cornflowerblue"&gt;**you**&lt;/span&gt; need to know their GitHub username...

![](invite.png)

class: inverse 

## .fancy[Using (a now shared) repository]

Especially when working on *shared* projects, make sure to "pull" &lt;span style="color:cornflowerblue"&gt;every time you access the project&lt;/span&gt; - this will ensure that you have (locally) the most up-to-date information that is available for the shared project.

## Notifications

There is an option to be notified (via e-mail) when somebody makes a push to a repository that you "own". This alerts you to the fact that a change has been made, and reminds you that you should "pull" prior to working on the project. To activate these notifications, navigate to the repository on GitHub, then enter your e-mail address... 

![](notification.png)

## Notifications (II)

.pull-right[
&lt;font size="5"&gt;.fancy[If you wish to recieve notifications from a repository that you collaborate on but do not "own", [GitHub has depreciated that legacy  function](https://github.community/t/get-notified-of-all-commits-to-all-branches-of-a-repo/759). The cleanest workaround that we have found seems to be [to use  zzBots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jssX19RsozQ). Note however that the free version of zzBots limits you to notifications from only two unowned repositories.]
]&lt;/font&gt;

---

## Notifications (III) <i class="fas  fa-robot "></i>

1. Sign up for a free [zzBots account](https://www.zzbots.com/)
2. Connect your new zzBots account to GitHub
3. Follow the menu to create a new bot 
4. Indicate bot name and follow prompts (starting with "send email")

## .fancy[Forking vs. branching]

Forks are different paths that a project may take (e.g., point of divergence) toward a different end-goal, whereas branches are shorter-term (typically) "construction zones" where edits can be temporarily held before being integrated into the master branch. There are a few helpful descriptions located [here](https://youtu.be/KDUtjZHIx44?t=658) [here](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/branch-or-fork-your-repository/) and [here](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/the-definitive-guide-to-forks-and-branches-in-git#:~:text=Forking%20creates%20a%20full%20copy,what%20branch%20you%20are%20using.-)

If you find a repository that you'd like to copy (e.g., use it as a template to build something yourself), then "fork" it.

![](https://www.pluralsight.com/content/pluralsight/en/blog/software-development/the/the-definitive-guide-to-forks-and-branches-in-git/jcr:content/main/image/image-res.img.9fc1f77b-d4c2-4269-9cda-d7fb7705504e.jpg)

## .fancy[Defining a new branch]

Best *developer* practice seems to entail creating branches within which proposed edits can be made and reviewed prior to "merging" back into the master branch (the master is where the initial files were placed, but also where the final product will be located).

You can create a new GitHub branch from within RStudio via the `New Branch` option on the `Git` tab of <i class="fab  fa-r-project "></i> Studio's "Environment/History/etc." pane.

If you still want to work with branches, make sure you understand the broader merge process - branches being ahead and behind each other seems to create chaos
