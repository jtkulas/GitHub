## Learning to use GitHub through R Studio

Summer 2020 Team:

## Goals

1. ~~figure out how to integrate GitHub and R Studio~~
2. connect individual accounts to shared projects
3. [figure out branches and forks](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/the-definitive-guide-to-forks-and-branches-in-git#:~:text=Forking%20creates%20a%20full%20copy,what%20branch%20you%20are%20using.-)
    + ...and how to use them
4. learn how to ask for a task to be completed
5. learn how to approve tasks
6. share what we've learned with the larger group (if interested)

## Progress so far...

1. We have [located a site that walks-through the setup](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) from within RStudio.

## Progress so far...

We have changed .Rmd files within online GitHub repositories via local editing, commits, and pushes.

## Forking vs. branching

Sounds like forks are different paths that a project may take (e.g., point of divergence) toward a different end-goal, whereas branches are shorter-term (typically) "construction zones" where edits can be temporarily held before being integrated in the master branch.

Duplicate (local) repositories are created when creating the initial master branch (this doesn't seem to be something unique to "forking")

## Lingering questions...

What are all of these files? (they keep multiplying)

## How to

We should have some "how to" slides so others can use
